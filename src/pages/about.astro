                        <p>Anoop is a curious, driven person who likes understanding how things actually work instead of just memorizing surface-level stuff. He’s into machine learning, ethical hacking, and building things that make sense, especially systems that are transparent and trustworthy. He gets bored fast with nonsense, prefers straight talk, and works best when there’s a clear goal in front of him. Tight on resources but not on ambition, he’s focused on leveling up his skills and carving out something solid for himself, even when things are messy.</p>
